### I. Introduction: The Scandal of Easy-Believism

The modern evangelical church faces a crisis: sanctuaries filled with false converts who've been assured of salvation based on a one-time prayer or intellectual assent to facts about Jesus. Churches systematically avoid or explain away the Bible's severe warning passages because they contradict the "once saved, always comfortable" gospel that fills pews and offering plates.

But Scripture contains these warnings precisely *because* false assurance is damning. The New Testament writers knew that not everyone who professes Christ possesses Christ. They knew that some who start the race will not finish. They knew that the visible church contains both wheat and tares, both genuine believers and convincing counterfeits.

Moreover, the church has abandoned biblical categories—*anathema* and *herem*—that were designed to guard the community from false teaching and unrepentant sin. We've traded holiness for niceness, and the cost is measured in souls.

**Thesis:** The warning passages of Scripture reveal that false assurance is rampant, deadly, and must be confronted. The church must recover the biblical practice of pronouncing anathema on false gospels and exercising church discipline, not out of harshness, but out of faithfulness to Christ and love for souls.

### II. The Major Warning Passages

#### A. Matthew 7:21-23 — "I Never Knew You"

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"

**Exegetical observations:**

- These people address Jesus as "Lord" (κύριε)—they made verbal profession
- They performed miracles, cast out demons, prophesied—all *in Jesus' name*
- Their religious activity was not merely external—it involved supernatural power
- Yet Jesus' verdict is devastating: "I *never* knew you" (οὐδέποτε ἔγνων ὑμᾶς)

**Key issue: relational knowing vs. functional activity**

The Greek verb γινώσκω (know) here is not cognitive—it's relational and covenantal. Jesus is not saying, "I never had information about you." He's saying, "I never had covenant relationship with you." This is the language of Amos 3:2 ("You only have I known of all the families of the earth") and the marriage relationship (Genesis 4:1, Adam "knew" Eve).

The terrifying word is *never* (οὐδέποτε). Jesus does not say, "I once knew you but you fell away." He says, "I *never* knew you"—their entire religious life was built on delusion.

They are called "workers of lawlessness" (ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν)—despite their external works *for* Jesus, they were actually working *against* His law. They had external religious performance but no saving union with Christ.

**Application:** Profession without possession damns. Religious activity—even spectacular activity—proves nothing. What matters is: Does Jesus know *you*?

---

#### B. Matthew 7:24-27 — Two Builders

> "Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it."

**Exegetical observations:**

- Both builders *hear* Jesus' words (ἀκούει)
- The difference: one *does* them (ποιεῖ), the other does not
- Both houses face the same storm (judgment)
- One stands, one falls—catastrophically

**The issue: obedience as the test of reality**

The participle ποιῶν (doing) is present active—continuous, habitual obedience. This is not sinless perfection, but a life pattern oriented toward obeying Christ.

The storm is eschatological judgment. Both houses looked similar externally—perhaps even identical. But the foundation was different. False assurance is building on sand while *thinking* you're on rock. The storm doesn't create the problem—it reveals what was always true.

**Application:** Hearing without doing is damnation. The person who nods along to sermons, agrees with doctrine, maybe even teaches Sunday school—but does not *obey*—is building on sand.

#### C. Matthew 21:42-44 — The Crushing Stone

> "Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes"? Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.'"

**Exegetical observations:**

- Jesus quotes Psalm 118:22—He is the rejected stone that becomes the cornerstone
- The religious leaders are the "builders" who reject Him
- **Verse 44 (often skipped in preaching):** Two ways to encounter the Stone
  1. Fall on it → be broken to pieces (συνθλάω—shatter, break in pieces)
  2. Have it fall on you → be crushed/ground to powder (λικμάω—winnow, pulverize)

**Two encounters with Christ the Stone:**

1. **Fall on Him now** = be broken in repentance
   - This echoes Psalm 51:17: "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise"
   - To fall on Christ is to come to Him in humility, recognizing your sin, allowing Him to shatter your pride and self-righteousness
   - This breaking is painful but salvific

2. **Have Him fall on you later** = be crushed in judgment
   - This is Daniel 2:34-35, 44-45—the stone that crushes all kingdoms
   - The language is eschatological judgment—final, irreversible, total destruction
   - λικμάω means to grind to powder, to winnow chaff—nothing remains

**Context matters:**

Matthew 21:45 tells us the audience: "When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them." These are not stumbling Christians. These are religious leaders who reject Christ and will face His wrath.

**Application:**

This is not about believers who "stumble" and lose rewards. This is about those who refuse to be broken *by* Christ in repentance and will therefore be broken *under* Christ in judgment. There is no third option. You will be broken one way or the other.

The terrifying reality: many people want Jesus as Savior but not as Lord. They want the benefits of the kingdom without submission to the King. Jesus says: that person will be ground to powder.

#### D. Hebrews 6:4-6 — Impossible to Renew to Repentance

> "For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt."

**Exegetical observations:**

The passage describes people with extensive spiritual experience:
- **Enlightened** (φωτισθέντας)—brought into the light
- **Tasted the heavenly gift** (γευσαμένους τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς ἐπουρανίου)—experienced something from heaven
- **Shared in the Holy Spirit** (μετόχους γενηθέντας πνεύματος ἁγίου)—participated in/partook of the Spirit
- **Tasted God's word and powers of the age to come**—experienced kingdom realities

Then: **παραπίπτω** (parapipto)—fall away, commit apostasy, fall aside from the path

The verdict: **ἀδύνατον** (adunaton)—*impossible* to renew them to repentance

**Three views of this text:**

1. **Hypothetical Warning View** (some Reformed)
   - The author is describing an impossibility to show it *won't* happen to true believers
   - True believers cannot fall away, so this is a warning against something that cannot actually occur for the elect
   - **Problem:** The text doesn't read as hypothetical—it states a real danger

2. **Apostasy of the Non-Elect View** (Reformed/Calvinist consensus)
   - These people experienced *covenant blessings* externally but were never regenerate
   - They were in the visible church, participated in its life, saw miracles, received teaching—but the Spirit never regenerated them
   - Their "sharing" in the Holy Spirit was external (like Saul prophesying, or Judas casting out demons), not regenerating
   - Their apostasy reveals they were never truly saved (cf. 1 John 2:19)
   - The impossibility of renewal shows God's judicial hardening after persistent rejection
   - **This view maintains both the warning's severity and the perseverance of true saints**

3. **Real Apostasy of True Believers View** (Arminian/Wesleyan)
   - These were genuinely regenerate believers who lost salvation
   - Once lost, they cannot be renewed—salvation cannot be regained
   - **This view is exegetically untenable and contradicts clear biblical teaching on the perseverance of the saints (John 10:27-29, Rom 8:28-39, Phil 1:6, 1 Pet 1:3-5)**

**The correct interpretation (View 2):**

The severity of the language matches the severity of the sin: these apostates are "crucifying the Son of God all over again and holding Him up to public contempt" (ἀνασταυροῦντας... καὶ παραδειγματίζοντας). They have so thoroughly rejected Christ that to return to Him would be to re-crucify Him—which is impossible because He died once for all (Hebrews 10:10).

This passage describes people who were in the covenant community, experienced its blessings, but were never regenerated. Their apostasy reveals their true state. The impossibility of renewal is God's judicial hardening—they have committed the unpardonable sin of final rejection.

**Application:**

Regardless of theological system, **all agree this passage warns against false assurance**. No one who treats salvation lightly, who continues in willful sin, who plays games with grace should feel safe based on a past experience. The question is not "Did I once make a decision?" but "Am I continuing in faith and repentance?"

#### E. Hebrews 10:26-31 — No Sacrifice Remains

> "For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine; I will repay.' And again, 'The Lord will judge his people.' It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

**Exegetical observations:**

- "If *we* go on sinning deliberately" (ἑκουσίως ἁμαρτανόντων ἡμῶν)—present tense, continuous action, *willfully*
- "After receiving the knowledge of the truth" (μετὰ τὸ λαβεῖν τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τῆς ἀληθείας)—this is not ignorant sin, but informed rejection
- "No sacrifice remains" (οὐκέτι... ἀπολείπεται θυσία)—the cross is final; there is no Plan B
- "A fearful expectation of judgment" (φοβερὰ... ἐκδοχὴ κρίσεως)—this person knows what's coming
- The comparison: worse than death under the Law (v. 28)

**Three descriptions of the apostate (v. 29):**

1. **Trampled underfoot the Son of God** (καταπατήσας τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ)—treated Him with utter contempt
2. **Profaned the blood of the covenant** (τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης κοινὸν ἡγησάμενος)—considered Christ's blood *common*, not sacred
3. **Outraged the Spirit of grace** (τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς χάριτος ἐνυβρίσας)—insulted, outraged, treated with contempt

The person "was sanctified" (ἡγιάσθη) by the blood of the covenant—this is covenant language, not necessarily regeneration language. The person was set apart externally as part of the covenant community but apostatizes.

**This is not about isolated sins or even seasons of backsliding.** The present participle (ἁμαρτανόντων) indicates willful, sustained, deliberate rejection of Christ after full knowledge. This is the unpardonable sin.

**Application:**

The person who says, "I can sin now and repent later" is playing with fire. The person who presumes on grace, who treats Christ's sacrifice as common, who deliberately continues in sin while claiming to be saved—this passage says **there is no sacrifice left for you**. Only judgment.

"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (v. 31). Modern preaching has turned God into a cosmic therapist. This passage reminds us: our God is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29).

#### F. Hebrews 12:14-17 — Esau's Irreversible Loss

> "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no 'root of bitterness' springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears."

**Exegetical observations:**

- "Strive for... holiness without which no one will see the Lord" (v. 14)—holiness is non-negotiable
- Warning: don't be like Esau—sexually immoral or "unholy" (βέβηλος—profane, treating sacred things as common)
- Esau "sold his birthright for a single meal"—despised what was sacred for momentary gratification
- **Verse 17:** "He found no chance to repent" (μετανοίας... τόπον οὐχ εὗρεν), "though he sought it with tears" (καίπερ μετὰ δακρύων ἐκζητήσας αὐτήν)

**The terrifying example of Esau:**

Genesis 25:29-34—Esau despised his birthright and sold it for stew. He treated something sacred (the covenant blessing) as worthless.

Genesis 27—Years later, Esau desperately wanted the blessing. He wept, he begged, he pleaded with Isaac. But it was too late. Isaac said, "I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed" (v. 33). The blessing was irrevocable.

Hebrews uses Esau as an example of someone who **despised what was sacred, then later wanted it back—but repentance was impossible**.

**What does "found no chance to repent" mean?**

The Greek is ambiguous: did Esau find no place for repentance, or did Isaac find no place to change his mind? Either way, the point is the same: **the opportunity was lost, and it could not be recovered**.

**Application:**

This crushes the modern idea that "you can always come back to Jesus later." The prodigal son came back—but not everyone does. Some people harden their hearts so thoroughly that they pass the point of no return.

The person who despises Christ now, thinking they can repent on their deathbed, may find that the door is shut. As Proverbs 1:24-28 warns: "I called and you refused... then they will call upon me, but I will not answer."

Esau's tears were not tears of true repentance—they were tears of regret over losing the blessing. He wanted the benefit without submission. That is not repentance.

#### G. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 / Galatians 5:19-21 — Vice Lists and Exclusion

**1 Corinthians 6:9-10:**

**Galatians 5:19-21:**
> "Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."

**Exegetical observations:**

- Paul's concern: **μὴ πλανᾶσθε** (mē planasthe)—"Do not be deceived," "Stop being led astray"
  - This is present imperative—Paul is addressing an *ongoing* deception
  - People were apparently claiming kingdom inheritance while living in unrepentant sin
  - Paul confronts the lie directly

- The phrase "will not inherit the kingdom" (βασιλείαν θεοῦ οὐ κληρονομήσουσιν)—future tense, emphatic negation
  - This is not about losing rewards—it's about **exclusion from salvation**
  - "Inherit the kingdom" = enter eternal life

- The list includes both "respectable" sins (greed, envy, strife) and "scandalous" sins (sexual immorality, drunkenness, idolatry)
  - All are equally disqualifying
  - The church tends to tolerate greed and gossip while condemning sexual sin—Paul makes no such distinction

**Key grammatical point: the present active participle**

In Galatians 5:21, "those who *do* such things" translates οἱ τὰ τοιαῦτα **πράσσοντες**—the present active participle indicates *continuous, habitual practice*.

This is not about:
- Believers who struggle with sin and fight against it
- Believers who fall into sin, feel conviction, and repent
- Believers who sin but hate their sin

This is about:
- Unrepentant, habitual practice of sin
- A life pattern characterized by these works
- Someone who identifies with the sin, not with Christ

**Paul's pastoral concern:**

The Corinthian and Galatian churches were being told, "You're free in Christ! You can live however you want!" Paul says: **Stop being deceived. If you practice these things, you will not inherit the kingdom.**

This is not sinless perfectionism. Christians sin. But Christians do not *practice* sin as a life pattern. 1 John 3:9 says it clearly: "No one born of God makes a practice of sinning" (πᾶς ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ θεοῦ ἁμαρτίαν οὐ ποιεῖ—present tense, continuous action).

**Application:**

If your life is characterized by unrepentant sexual immorality, greed, drunkenness, gossip, strife, or any of these things—and you feel no conviction, no sorrow, no desire to change—you are not saved. Paul says it plainly: **such people will not inherit the kingdom**.

The modern church is filled with people who "prayed the prayer" but live like the world. Paul's message to them is not, "You're fine, you're just carnal Christians." His message is: **"Do not be deceived—you will not inherit the kingdom of God."**

#### H. 2 Peter 2:20-22 — Better Not to Have Known

> "For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. What the true proverb says has happened to them: 'The dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.'"

**Exegetical observations:**

- These people "escaped the defilements of the world" (ἀποφυγόντες τὰ μιάσματα τοῦ κόσμου)—they experienced moral reformation
- "Through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" (ἐν ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ κυρίου... Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ)—they had real knowledge of Christ
- "They are again entangled and overcome" (ἐμπλακέντες... ἡττῶνται)—they return to sin and are mastered by it
- "The last state has become worse than the first"—their end is worse than if they'd never known Christ

**Verse 21: the devastating verdict**

"It would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them."

This echoes Jesus in Matthew 11:21-24—it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in judgment than for cities that saw Jesus' miracles and rejected Him. Greater privilege brings greater accountability. To know the truth and reject it is worse than never knowing.

**Verse 22: the proverbs reveal their nature**

"The dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire."

- The dog was always a dog—vomiting and returning is its nature
- The sow was always a pig—you can wash a pig, but it will return to the mud because that's its nature
- **The point:** These people experienced external reformation (the washing), but no internal regeneration (new nature)

**Peter's context: false teachers in chapter 2**

These are not struggling believers—these are false teachers who infiltrate the church, cause divisions, deny the Lord, and lead others astray (2 Peter 2:1-3). Their judgment is certain (v. 3), their destruction assured (v. 12).

**Application:**

Some people have "turned their lives around," cleaned up their act, joined the church, learned the language—but never truly been born again. They have knowledge *about* Christ but no saving union *with* Christ.

When the pressure comes, when the cost gets high, when following Christ means sacrifice—they return to the world. And their end is worse than if they'd never known.

This is not about believers who fall into sin and repent. This is about false professors whose temporary reformation masks an unchanged heart.

#### I. 1 John 2:19 — They Went Out Because They Were Never Of Us

> "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us."

**Exegetical observations:**

- "They went out from us" (ἐξῆλθαν ἐξ ἡμῶν)—they left the church
- "But they were not of us" (ἀλλ' οὐκ ἦσαν ἐξ ἡμῶν)—they were never truly part of the body
- The proof: "if they had been of us, they would have continued with us" (εἰ... ἦσαν ἐξ ἡμῶν, μεμενήκεισαν ἂν μεθ' ἡμῶν)—perseverance proves reality
- The purpose of their departure: "that it might become plain that they all are not of us" (ἵνα φανερωθῶσιν ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶν πάντες ἐξ ἡμῶν)—apostasy is revelatory, not transformative

**John's theology of perseverance:**

Throughout 1 John, perseverance is evidence of new birth:
- 1 John 2:3-6—"By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments"
- 1 John 3:9-10—"No one born of God makes a practice of sinning"
- 1 John 5:4—"Everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world"

John does not say, "They were once saved but lost their salvation." He says, "They left because they were never truly one of us."

**The Reformed doctrine of perseverance:**

This passage is foundational for the doctrine that true believers persevere to the end. Not because of their own strength, but because God keeps them (1 Peter 1:5, "kept by the power of God through faith"). Those who apostatize reveal that they were never regenerated.

**But this means something terrifying:**

Some people who look, sound, and act like Christians *are not Christians*. They sit in church, sing the songs, know the doctrine, serve in ministries—but they are unregenerate. And the way this is revealed is: **they do not continue**.

**Application:**

Perseverance is not optional—it's the evidence of reality. The person who says, "I believe in Jesus" but then walks away from the faith was never saved to begin with.

This should drive us to self-examination: Am I continuing in faith? Am I fighting sin? Do I love Christ more this year than last year? Or am I drifting?

Hebrews 2:1—"Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it."

### III. What These Passages Teach About False Assurance

Synthesizing the warning passages yields these conclusions:

1. **Assurance based on past religious experience is insufficient**
   - Matthew 7:22-23—"Did we not prophesy... cast out demons... do mighty works in Your name?"
   - Hebrews 6:4-6—enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, shared in the Holy Spirit
   - Past experience is not proof of present reality

2. **Profession without obedience is dead**
   - Matthew 7:21—"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter"
   - James 2:14-26—"Faith apart from works is dead"
   - 1 John 2:3-6—"By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments"

3. **Some apostasy is final and irreversible**
   - Hebrews 6:6—"impossible to restore them again to repentance"
   - Hebrews 12:17—Esau "found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears"
   - 2 Peter 2:20-22—"the last state has become worse for them than the first"
   - There is a point of no return

4. **Continuance in sin is evidence of non-salvation**
   - 1 Corinthians 6:9-10—"Do not be deceived: [those who practice these things] will not inherit the kingdom of God"
   - Galatians 5:19-21—"those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God"
   - 1 John 3:6-10—"No one born of God makes a practice of sinning"

5. **Apostasy reveals what was always hidden**
   - 1 John 2:19—"They went out from us, but they were not of us"
   - The apostate was never regenerate—the leaving proves it

6. **There are degrees of judgment**
   - Matthew 11:20-24—more tolerable for Sodom than for Capernaum
   - Luke 12:47-48—the servant who knew his master's will and didn't do it will receive a severe beating
   - Hebrews 10:29—"How much worse punishment... will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God"
   - Hell is not uniform—greater light brings greater accountability

7. **Refusal to be broken by Christ now results in being crushed by Christ later**
   - Matthew 21:44—fall on the stone now (be broken in repentance) or have the stone fall on you later (be crushed in judgment)
   - There is no third option

### IV. Anathema (Ἀνάθεμα): The New Testament Category

#### A. Definition and Background

The Greek word **ἀνάθεμα** (anathema) means "something devoted to God for destruction." It is the LXX translation of the Hebrew **חֵרֶם** (herem), which carries the same meaning: devoted to divine curse, set apart for judgment, placed under the ban.

In classical Greek, ἀνάθημα (with an eta) meant "a votive offering"—something dedicated to a god. But ἀνάθεμα (with an epsilon) took on a darker meaning: something dedicated to destruction.

The concept is covenantal. To be anathema is to be cut off from the covenant community and devoted to God's wrath. It is not a curse in the sense of magic or superstition—it is a **declaration of divine judgment**.

#### B. New Testament Usage

The word ἀνάθεμα appears six times in the New Testament. Each usage reveals the severity of the concept.

---

##### 1. Romans 9:3

> "For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh."

**Exegesis:**

Paul says he could wish himself **ἀνάθεμα** (anathema) for the salvation of Israel. This is staggering language. Paul is saying, "I would be willing to be devoted to destruction, cut off from Christ, for the sake of my people."

This echoes Moses in Exodus 32:32—"But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written." Both Moses and Paul are willing to bear covenant curse for others.

**What this shows:**

The weight of anathema is such that Paul uses it to describe the most extreme possible sacrifice. To be anathema is to be **under divine wrath, separated from Christ, devoted to judgment**. This is not a light term.

---

##### 2. 1 Corinthians 12:3

> "Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says 'Jesus is accursed,' and no one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except in the Holy Spirit."

**Exegesis:**

Paul addresses a situation where some in Corinth were apparently claiming Spirit-inspiration while saying **Ἀνάθεμα Ἰησοῦς** (anathema Iēsous)—"Jesus is cursed" or "Cursed be Jesus."

This could be:
- Unbelieving Jews in the synagogue cursing Jesus
- Gentile believers pressured to curse Jesus under persecution
- False "prophets" in ecstatic states denouncing Jesus

Paul's test: **the Spirit never leads anyone to curse Jesus**. True spiritual experience exalts Christ; it never denigrates Him.

**What this shows:**

To say "Jesus is anathema" is to devote Him to destruction, to declare Him worthy of divine curse. This is blasphemy. The test of genuine spiritual experience is: Does it honor Jesus as Lord?

---

##### 3. 1 Corinthians 16:22

> "If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord,come!"

**Exegesis:**

Paul concludes his letter with a severe pronouncement: **εἴ τις οὐ φιλεῖ τὸν κύριον, ἤτω ἀνάθεμα** (ei tis ou philei ton kyrion, ētō anathema)—"If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed."

The verb φιλέω (phileō) is not mere intellectual assent—it's affectionate love, personal devotion. Paul is not saying, "If anyone disagrees with a doctrine about Jesus." He's saying, "If anyone has no love *for Jesus Himself*."

Immediately following: **Μαρανα θα** (Marana tha)—"Our Lord, come!" This is Aramaic, transliterated into Greek, preserved from the earliest Aramaic-speaking church. It's an eschatological cry: "Lord Jesus, return!"

**The connection between anathema and Marana tha:**

Paul invokes divine curse on those who do not love Christ, then immediately cries out for Christ's return. Why? Because Christ's return will execute the anathema. The curse awaits final judgment.

This is not vindictiveness—it's eschatological urgency. Christ is coming to separate wheat from tares, sheep from goats, those who love Him from those who do not.

**What this shows:**

Loving Christ is not optional. It is the test of salvation. 1 John 4:19—"We love because he first loved us." If there is no love for Christ, there is no salvation. And Paul does not hesitate to pronounce anathema.

This confronts the modern "decide for Jesus" gospel that asks for intellectual agreement but not heart affection. Paul says: **if you don't love Jesus, you are under God's curse**.

---

##### 4. Galatians 1:8-9 — The Most Explicit Use

> "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed."

**Exegesis:**

Paul pronounces anathema **twice** in successive verses. This is emphatic, deliberate, and uncompromising.

- **Verse 8:** "Even if *we* or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, **ἀνάθεμα ἔστω**" (anathema estō)—"let him be accursed"
- **Verse 9:** "As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, **ἀνάθεμα ἔστω**"

**Key observations:**

1. **Paul includes himself hypothetically**
   - "Even if *we*"—Paul does not exempt himself
   - If Paul himself were to preach a different gospel, he should be anathema
   - This shows the objectivity of the gospel—it is not based on apostolic authority per se, but on the truth of the message

2. **Even an angel from heaven**
   - Angels are God's messengers, yet even angelic authority cannot override gospel truth
   - This anticipates 2 Corinthians 11:14—Satan disguises himself as an angel of light
   - Authority must be tested by conformity to the gospel

3. **"A gospel contrary to" (παρ' ὃ... ἕτερον εὐαγγέλιον)**
   - The false gospel in Galatia was "Jesus + circumcision," "faith + works of the law"
   - Any addition to or subtraction from the gospel of grace through faith in Christ alone is damnable
   - The Judaizers were not denying Jesus—they were adding requirements. Paul says: **that's a different gospel, and it damns you**

4. **The repetition—"so now I say again"**
   - Paul had warned them before (probably on his previous visit)
   - He repeats it now in writing
   - The double anathema is not rhetorical excess—it's pastoral urgency

**The gospel as boundary marker:**

For Paul, the gospel is not negotiable. It is the power of God for salvation (Romans 1:16). To preach another gospel is to preach another way of salvation—which is no gospel at all (Galatians 1:6-7, "there is not another one").

The false gospel leads to destruction. Therefore, Paul pronounces anathema—not out of personal animosity, but out of love for souls and zeal for God's glory.

**What this shows:**

The church must guard the gospel. False teachers who distort the gospel must be identified, opposed, and if they persist, pronounced anathema. This is not unloving—it is protecting the flock from poison.

Modern evangelicalism has abandoned this. We platform false teachers, sign joint statements with those who deny justification by faith alone, and tolerate "another gospel" in the name of unity. Paul's response: **anathema**.

---

#### C. Why Anathema is Misunderstood

The modern church has lost the category of anathema for several reasons:

##### 1. Sentimentalism

Modern Christianity prioritizes niceness over holiness, therapy over truth. The idea that we would pronounce divine curse on anyone—even a false teacher—feels harsh, judgmental, unloving.

But this conflates gentleness with compromise. Jesus called the Pharisees "whitewashed tombs" and "children of hell" (Matthew 23:27, 15). Paul wished that the Judaizers would castrate themselves (Galatians 5:12). Peter called false teachers "irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed" (2 Peter 2:12).

Biblical love does not coddle error—it confronts it.

##### 2. Individualism

We've lost the category of *corporate covenantal judgment*. We think of salvation as "Jesus and me," and we've forgotten that the church is a covenant community with boundaries.

Anathema is not about personal vendetta—it's about covenant exclusion. The person under anathema is outside the covenant, under God's wrath, and the church declares this reality.

##### 3. Pluralism

"All roads lead to God" thinking makes anathema seem barbaric. If everyone's sincere beliefs are valid, then pronouncing curse on false teaching is intolerant bigotry.

But Paul does not believe all roads lead to God. He believes there is one gospel (Ephesians 4:5, "one Lord, one faith, one baptism"), and to preach another is damnation.

##### 4. Cheap Grace

If everyone's going to heaven anyway—if God is too loving to judge—then why curse anyone?

But this is not the God of Scripture. Our God is "a consuming fire" (Hebrews 12:29). He "will by no means clear the guilty" (Exodus 34:7). Grace is not opposed to judgment—grace is God's mercy to some *in the midst of* His just judgment on all.

##### 5. Confusion with Personal Vendetta

People think anathema means "I hate you" or "I'm angry at you." But that's not what it means.

Anathema is not personal—it's theological. It's not "I curse you"—it's "God's curse is on you unless you repent." It's not vindictive—it's declarative.

Paul could wish himself anathema for Israel's salvation (Romans 9:3)—this is not hatred, it's love. Anathema is a warning: *you are outside the covenant and under wrath; repent and believe the gospel*.

---

### V. Herem (חֵרֶם): The Old Testament Background

#### A. Definition

The Hebrew root **חרם** (haram) means "to devote, ban, consecrate for destruction." The noun **חֵרֶם** (herem) refers to something placed under the ban, devoted to Yahweh for destruction.

Herem is not arbitrary violence. It is **covenantal holy war**—God's judgment executed through His people against those who have filled up their measure of sin.

The concept involves total devotion to Yahweh:
- Sometimes this means destruction (Jericho)
- Sometimes this means the treasury of Yahweh (silver and gold from Jericho)
- Always it means: this belongs to God, not to man

To take herem for yourself is to steal from God. To become herem is to come under God's judgment.

---

#### B. Key Texts

##### 1. Deuteronomy 7:1-2, 25-26 — The Ban on Canaanites and Their Idols

**Deuteronomy 7:1-2:**
> "When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you... and when the LORD your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them."

**Deuteronomy 7:25-26:**
> "The carved images of their gods you shall burn with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God. And you shall not bring an abominable thing into your house and become devoted to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is devoted to destruction."

**Exegesis:**

Israel is commanded to devote the Canaanite nations to herem—complete destruction. Why?

1. **Judgment on sin** (Genesis 15:16, "the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete")—400 years later, it was
2. **Holiness of God's people**—idolatry is contagious; separation is necessary
3. **Prevention of syncretism**—if Israel makes covenants with pagans, they will adopt pagan worship

The idols themselves are herem. To bring them into your house is to **become herem yourself**—the curse is contagious.

**Application:**

Holiness requires separation from corrupting evil. The church is not called to physical warfare, but we are called to spiritual warfare—"destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God" (2 Corinthians 10:4-5).

We cannot tolerate false teaching in the church and expect to remain holy.

---

##### 2. Joshua 6:17-19 — Jericho Devoted to Yahweh

> "And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it. But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD. They shall go into the treasury of the LORD."

**Exegesis:**

Jericho is the firstfruits of the Conquest. Therefore, it belongs wholly to Yahweh. The city and everything in it is herem.

- Living things: destroyed (except Rahab and her family)
- Precious metals: go into Yahweh's treasury
- Everything else: burned

Why? **Because Jericho is firstfruits, and firstfruits belong entirely to God** (Proverbs 3:9, Exodus 23:19).

The warning: "Keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest... you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction."

Herem is contagious. If you take herem, you become herem. If you become herem, the whole camp becomes herem.

**Application:**

What belongs to God is not ours to take. Sin brings corporate consequences—one man's sin can affect the entire community (as we'll see with Achan).

---

##### 3. Joshua 7 — Achan's Sin and Israel's Defeat

**The narrative:**

- Joshua 6: Jericho falls; everything is herem
- Joshua 7:1: "But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan... took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel."
- Joshua 7:2-5: Israel attacks Ai—a small, weak city. They are routed, 36 men die. "The hearts of the people melted and became as water."
- Joshua 7:10-12: God reveals the problem—"Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings. Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies... **I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you**."

**The investigation and judgment:**

- Lots are cast (Joshua 7:14-18): tribe → clan → family → man
- Achan is identified
- Joshua 7:20-21: Achan confesses—"I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, then I coveted them and took them."
- Joshua 7:24-26: Achan, his sons, daughters, livestock, and possessions are taken to the Valley of Achor. They are stoned and burned. A heap of stones is raised over them.

**Key theological points:**

1. **One man's sin brought corporate judgment**
   - Achan sinned, but "the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel" (7:1)
   - Israel could not stand before enemies (7:12)
   - This is covenant solidarity—the community is one body

2. **God describes Achan's sin in detail (7:11):**
   - "They have sinned"
   - "They have transgressed my covenant"
   - "They have taken some of the devoted things"
   - "They have stolen"
   - "They have lied"
   - "They have put them among their own belongings"
   - Five descriptions of the same act—showing its multi-faceted evil

3. **Herem contaminated Achan's household**
   - His family was stoned with him
   - This seems harsh to modern readers, but it reflects the contagious nature of herem
   - The devoted things were in his tent—the entire household was contaminated

4. **The place is named Achor—"trouble"**
   - Joshua 7:25—"Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today."
   - Hosea 2:15 later speaks of the Valley of Achor as a "door of hope"—God can redeem even places of judgment

**Application:**

Sin has consequences beyond the individual. The church must deal with sin in its midst, or the entire body suffers. This is why church discipline is not optional—it protects the community.

---

##### 4. 1 Samuel 15 — Saul's Disobedience and Loss of the Kingdom

**The command (1 Samuel 15:1-3):**

> "Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey."

Why Amalek? Exodus 17:8-16—Amalek attacked Israel in the wilderness, preying on the weak and struggling. Deuteronomy 25:17-19—"Remember what Amalek did to you... how he attacked you on the way when you were faint and weary, and cut off your tail, those who were lagging behind you, and he did not fear God."

God's verdict: "The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation" (Exodus 17:16). Amalek is under permanent herem.

**Saul's disobedience (1 Samuel 15:7-9):**

Saul defeats Amalek but:
- Spares King Agag
- Spares "the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good"
- Only destroys "all that was despised and worthless"

Saul executes partial obedience, which is disobedience.

**God's response (1 Samuel 15:10-11):**

> "The word of the LORD came to Samuel: 'I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.'"

**The confrontation (1 Samuel 15:13-23):**

- Saul greets Samuel: "I have performed the commandment of the LORD" (v. 13)
- Samuel: "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?" (v. 14)
- Saul: "They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God" (v. 15)—blame-shifting to "the people"
- Samuel: "Stop!" (v. 16)—then reminds Saul that God made him king and gave him a command
- Saul (v. 20-21): "I have obeyed... but the people took... to sacrifice"—more blame-shifting

**Samuel's verdict (1 Samuel 15:22-23):**

> "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."

**The execution of Agag (1 Samuel 15:32-33):**

Saul failed to execute herem, so Samuel does it himself:

> "Then Samuel said, 'Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.' And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, 'Surely the bitterness of death is past.' And Samuel said, 'As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.' And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."

**Theological lessons:**

1. **Partial obedience is disobedience**
   - Saul thought he could modify God's command
   - He kept what seemed valuable and destroyed what seemed worthless
   - God required total obedience

2. **Religious activity does not substitute for obedience**
   - Saul's excuse: "We saved the animals to sacrifice to God"
   - Samuel: "To obey is better than sacrifice"
   - You cannot disobey God and then offer Him worship with the fruits of your disobedience

3. **Blame-shifting does not work**
   - Saul repeatedly blamed "the people"
   - But he was the king—he was responsible
   - God held him accountable

4. **Consequences are severe**
   - Saul lost the kingdom (1 Samuel 15:28)
   - "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you"
   - That neighbor was David

**Application:**

God's commands are not suggestions. We do not get to modify them to suit our preferences. Modern evangelicalism tries to soften God's Word, make it more palatable, more culturally acceptable. God's response: **rejected**.

---

##### 5. Ezra 10:8 — Post-Exilic Application of Herem

> "And that if anyone did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles."

**Context:**

The exiles have returned to Jerusalem. Many Jewish men have married foreign women (Ezra 9:1-2). This is the same sin that led to the exile in the first place—intermarriage with pagans led to idolatry.

Ezra calls for separation: the foreign wives and their children must be sent away (Ezra 10:3). A proclamation goes out: all the exiles must assemble in Jerusalem within three days. Those who refuse will have their property forfeited and will be "banned" (יָחֳרַם—herem) from the congregation.

**Key observation:**

Herem is applied here not as the death penalty but as **excommunication**—exclusion from the covenant community.

This is the bridge to New Testament practice. The church does not execute people (we're not a theocratic nation-state), but we do excommunicate—we declare someone outside the covenant and under God's wrath.

---

#### C. Theological Purpose of Herem

Synthesizing the Old Testament texts, we see that herem served multiple purposes:

##### 1. Holiness of God

God is absolutely set apart from sin. His people must also be set apart. Herem creates a boundary between holy and profane, between God's people and those devoted to destruction.

##### 2. Judgment on Sin

The Canaanites' sin had reached full measure (Genesis 15:16). God's patience had run out. Herem was not genocide—it was divine judgment executed through human instruments (just as the Flood was divine judgment executed through water).

##### 3. Protection of Israel

Idolatry is contagious (Deuteronomy 7:3-4, "they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods"). Herem prevented contamination by removing the source of temptation.

##### 4. Eschatological Preview

Herem foreshadows final judgment. Just as God judged Canaan through Israel, He will judge the world through Christ. Matthew 13:41-42—"The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace."

##### 5. God's Ownership

All the spoils of war belong to Yahweh. To take herem is to steal from God. This underscores that everything belongs to Him—we are stewards, not owners.

---

### VI. Why Anathema/Herem Are Not Practiced Today

#### A. Theologically Valid Reasons

There are legitimate redemptive-historical reasons why the church does not practice herem in the same way Israel did:

##### 1. Redemptive-Historical Shift

The church is not a geopolitical nation-state executing civil theocracy. We do not wield the sword of state justice (Romans 13:4 assigns that to civil government, not the church).

Israel was a type—a shadow of the reality to come. The church is the reality—a spiritual kingdom made up of people from every nation (Revelation 5:9).

##### 2. Already/Not-Yet Eschatology

The final herem awaits Christ's return. Jesus taught the parable of the wheat and tares (Matthew 13:24-30): let them grow together until the harvest. The angels will separate them at the end of the age.

We do not execute final judgment now—that belongs to Christ at His return.

##### 3. The Church as Mission Outpost

We are sent *into* the world, not withdrawn *from* it (John 17:15-18, "I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one... As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world").

We eat with sinners to evangelize (Luke 15:1-2). We do not physically separate from the world—we are in it but not of it.

---

#### B. Illegitimate Reasons (Why We Should Recover the Category)

But many of the reasons the modern church avoids anathema/herem are not theologically valid—they are compromises:

##### 1. Sentimentalism and Pragmatism

Churches fear losing members, money, and reputation. Confronting sin costs donors. Pronouncing anathema on false teachers costs speaking invitations and book deals.

So churches tolerate what Scripture condemns. Pragmatism trumps truth.

##### 2. Fear of Man

"What will people think if we excommunicate someone?" Proverbs 29:25—"The fear of man lays a snare." We've traded the fear of God for the fear of man.

##### 3. Therapeutic Gospel

The modern church exists to make people feel good, not to call them to holiness. Church is therapy, not worship. Sermons are motivational talks, not exposition of Scripture.

In this paradigm, anathema is unthinkable—it would hurt people's feelings.

##### 4. Cheap Grace

"God loves everyone just as they are." True—but He loves us too much to leave us that way. Grace is not permission to sin—it's power to overcome sin (Titus 2:11-12, "the grace of God has appeared... training us to renounce ungodliness").

Cheap grace says, "God forgives, so it doesn't matter how you live." Costly grace says, "God forgives through the blood of His Son—therefore live worthy of that sacrifice."

##### 5. Loss of Church Discipline

1 Corinthians 5 is ignored in 95% of evangelical churches. We've lost the category of corporate holiness. Everyone does what is right in his own eyes (Judges 21:25).

---

### VII. The Correct Application Today

So how should the church apply anathema/herem in the New Covenant?

#### A. Church Discipline (Matthew 18:15-20; 1 Corinthians 5)

##### The Process (Matthew 18:15-20)

Jesus gives a four-step process for dealing with sin in the church:

**Step 1: Private Confrontation (v. 15)**
> "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

- Go privately first
- The goal is restoration ("gained your brother"), not punishment
- If he repents, it ends here—no need to escalate

**Step 2: Two or Three Witnesses (v. 16)**
> "But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."

- If private confrontation fails, bring witnesses
- This fulfills Deuteronomy 19:15—"A single witness shall not suffice... Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established"
- Still seeking restoration, but now with accountability

**Step 3: Tell It to the Church (v. 17a)**
> "If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church."

- Public announcement of the sin and the person's refusal to repent
- The whole congregation is now involved
- Corporate pressure to repent

**Step 4: Excommunication (v. 17b)**
> "And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

- Treat him as an outsider, not a brother
- This is formal exclusion from the covenant community
- He is no longer treated as a Christian

**The authority (vv. 18-20):**
> "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them."

The church's judgment is ratified in heaven. When the church excludes someone, heaven agrees. This is not the church creating reality—it's the church declaring reality.

##### The Example (1 Corinthians 5)

**The situation (vv. 1-2):**
> "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you."

- A man is sleeping with his stepmother (probably his father's second wife)
- This is condemned even by pagans—Roman law forbade it
- The Corinthian church is *proud* of their "tolerance"—they think they're being gracious
- Paul says: you should be in mourning, and he should be removed

**Paul's judgment (vv. 3-5):**
> "For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."

- Paul has already judged the case—the verdict is excommunication
- "Deliver this man to Satan"—remove him from the church (God's kingdom) and place him back in Satan's domain (the world)
- "For the destruction of the flesh"—that he might suffer the consequences of his sin physically
- "So that his spirit may be saved"—the goal is redemptive: shock him into repentance

**The reason (vv. 6-8):**
> "Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."

- Sin is like leaven—it spreads through the whole batch
- The church must remove the sin to protect the community
- This is Passover imagery—get rid of all leaven (Exodus 12:15-20)

**The command (vv. 9-13):**
> "I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people—not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one. For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. 'Purge the evil person from among you.'"

**Critical distinctions:**

1. **We *do* associate with unbelieving sinners**—"not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world... since then you would need to go out of the world"
   - Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners (Matthew 9:10-13)
   - We are in the world on mission

2. **We do *not* associate with so-called brothers living in unrepentant sin**—"not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of..."
   - This is not about unbelievers—it's about false professors
   - "Not even to eat with such a one"—no table fellowship, no casual socializing

3. **We judge *inside* the church, not outside**—"Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside."
   - The church's jurisdiction is the visible church
   - We call unbelievers to repentance, but we don't excommunicate them (they're already outside)
   - We hold professing believers to the standard of holiness

4. **"Purge the evil person from among you"**—this is herem language from Deuteronomy 17:7, 19:19, 21:21, 22:21, 24, 24:7
   - Paul applies Old Testament herem to New Testament church discipline
   - The continuity is clear: remove the unrepentant sinner to protect the community

**The three purposes of church discipline:**

1. **Protective**—keeps the church holy, prevents the leaven from spreading
2. **Declarative**—announces what is already true about the person's spiritual state (they are not truly regenerate if they persist in unrepentant sin)
3. **Redemptive**—designed to shock the person into repentance ("so that his spirit may be saved")

**The restoration (2 Corinthians 2:5-11):**

Apparently, the man in 1 Corinthians 5 repented. Paul writes:

> "Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure—not to put it too severely—to all of you. For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him... If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him... so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs."

The discipline worked—the man repented. Now Paul says: restore him. Forgive him. Comfort him. Reaffirm your love.

Church discipline is not permanent exile—it's designed to bring the person to repentance and restoration.

---

#### B. Guarding the Gospel (Galatians 1:8-9)

The church must identify and reject false teachers. This is not optional—it's commanded.

##### Romans 16:17
> "I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; **avoid them**."

- "Watch out for" (σκοπεῖν)—be on guard, pay attention to
- "Those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine"—false teachers who undermine sound teaching
- **"Avoid them"** (ἐκκλίνετε ἀπ' αὐτῶν)—turn away from them, have nothing to do with them

##### 2 John 10-11
> "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works."

- "Do not bring this teaching"—specifically, denial that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh (v. 7)
- "Do not receive him into your house"—no hospitality
- "Or give him any greeting"—no recognition, no fellowship
- Why? "Whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works"—association implies endorsement

##### Titus 3:10
> "As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him."

- The divisive person gets two warnings
- After that: **have nothing more to do with him** (παραιτοῦ)—reject, refuse, avoid

##### 1 Timothy 1:18-20
> "This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme."

- Paul names names: **Hymenaeus and Alexander**
- They have "made shipwreck of their faith"
- Paul has "handed them over to Satan"—formal excommunication
- Purpose: "that they may learn not to blaspheme"—still redemptive in intent

##### 2 Timothy 2:16-18
> "But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some."

- Again, Paul names names: **Hymenaeus and Philetus**
- Their false teaching: "the resurrection has already happened"—probably a proto-Gnostic spiritualizing of the bodily resurrection
- Result: "They are upsetting the faith of some"—false teaching destroys souls
- Paul's command: "Avoid irreverent babble"—don't engage with it

**Modern application:**

1. **Don't platform false teachers**
   - Don't invite them to speak at your church
   - Don't promote their books or podcasts
   - Don't give them credibility by association

2. **Publicly warn the church when necessary**
   - Paul named Hymenaeus, Alexander, and Philetus
   - This is not gossip—it's protecting the flock
   - Elders must "be able... to rebuke those who contradict" (Titus 1:9)

3. **Mark those who teach "another gospel"**
   - Galatians 1:8-9—anathema on false gospels
   - This includes: prosperity gospel, word-faith movement, progressive Christianity, inclusion theology, universalism, any system that adds works to grace or denies substitutionary atonement

4. **Do not be naïve about ecumenism**
   - "Unity" that compromises the gospel is not biblical unity
   - 2 Corinthians 6:14-17—"Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers... What accord has Christ with Belial?... Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord"

---

#### C. Personal Separation from Unrepentant Sin

##### 1 Corinthians 5:11
> "But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one."

**The principle:**

We are to separate from professing Christians who live in unrepentant sin. This does not mean we refuse to evangelize them or pray for them—it means we do not treat them as brothers in good standing.

**The categories Paul lists:**

1. **Sexually immoral** (πόρνος)—fornicators, adulterers, those living in sexual sin
2. **Greedy** (πλεονέκτης)—covetous, those whose lives are characterized by material pursuit
3. **Idolater** (εἰδωλολάτρης)—not just bowing to statues, but anything that displaces God as ultimate (Colossians 3:5, "covetousness, which is idolatry")
4. **Reviler** (λοίδορος)—verbally abusive, slanderer, gossip
5. **Drunkard** (μέθυσος)—habitual drunkenness
6. **Swindler** (ἅρπαξ)—thief, robber, extortioner

Note: these are not isolated sins but life patterns. Paul is describing someone whose life is characterized by these things.

**"Not even to eat with such a one":**

In the ancient world, table fellowship signified acceptance and endorsement. To eat with someone was to affirm them. Paul says: don't do it. Don't give the impression that you approve of their lifestyle.

##### 2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14-15
> "Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us... If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."

**The issue:**

Some in Thessalonica were idle—not working, living off others, busybodies (vv. 11-12).

**The command:**

- "Keep away from" (στέλλεσθαι)—withdraw from, avoid
- "Have nothing to do with him" (μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι)—do not associate with
- Purpose: "that he may be ashamed"—social consequences designed to produce repentance

**The balance:**

"Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother"—this is not hatred or vindictiveness. It's discipline within the covenant community. The person is still warned, prayed for, and called to repentance.

**Modern application:**

If someone in your church is living in unrepentant sin and refuses correction, you are to:
1. Stop treating them as a Christian in good standing
2. Not socialize with them casually ("not even to eat with such a one")
3. Continue to call them to repentance
4. Pray for their restoration

This is not cutting off all contact—it's changing the nature of the relationship from "fellow believer" to "person under church discipline whom I'm calling to repentance."

---

#### D. The Eschatological Anathema

##### 1 Corinthians 16:22
> "If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!"

The church recognizes that **final judgment belongs to Christ**. We do not execute people (we're not ancient Israel under the theocracy, and we're not the state with the power of the sword). But we do pronounce anathema **declaratively**—we announce what God has said.

**The categories of declarative anathema today:**

1. **Those who preach another gospel** (Galatians 1:8-9)
2. **Those who have no love for the Lord** (1 Corinthians 16:22)
3. **Those who deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh** (2 John 7)
4. **Those who practice sin habitually and show no fruit of regeneration** (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21)

We do not say, "I curse you." We say, "According to Scripture, you are under God's curse unless you repent."

**The eschatological hope:**

"Marana tha"—"Our Lord, come!" We long for Christ's return to execute final justice. The wicked will be judged. False teachers will be silenced. Apostates will face the crushing stone. And the righteous will be vindicated.

Romans 12:19—"Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.'"

We do not take vengeance—we trust God to repay. And we cry with the martyrs in Revelation 6:10, "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"

---

### VIII. Objections and Answers

#### Objection 1: "This is unloving and judgmental"

**Answer:**

Love requires truth (Ephesians 4:15, "speaking the truth in love"). To warn someone of judgment is the most loving thing you can do.

Jude 23—"Save others by snatching them out of the fire." If you saw someone walking toward a cliff, would you say nothing because you didn't want to seem judgmental? Or would you shout a warning?

Proverbs 27:5-6—"Better is open rebuke than hidden love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy."

**It is unloving to let someone think they're saved when they're not.** To give false assurance is to damn someone with a smile.

---

#### Objection 2: "Only God can judge"

**Answer:**

True—ultimate judgment belongs to God alone (James 4:12, "There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy").

But Scripture commands **us** to judge within the church:
- 1 Corinthians 5:12—"Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?"
- John 7:24—"Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment"
- 1 Corinthians 6:2-3—"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?... Do you not know that we are to judge angels?"

We judge **actions and teaching** according to Scripture. We do not judge **eternal destiny** finally (only God knows the heart). But we do make judgments about whether someone's profession and life are consistent with regeneration.

When the church excommunicates, we're saying: "Based on your unrepentant sin, we are treating you as an unbeliever until you repent." We're not saying, "We know for certain you're going to hell"—we're saying, "You're living like an unbeliever, so we're treating you like one."

---

#### Objection 3: "Jesus said 'judge not' (Matthew 7:1)"

**Answer:**

Context matters. Matthew 7:1-5 is about **hypocritical judgment**:

> "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?... You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."

Jesus is not forbidding all judgment—He's forbidding hypocritical judgment. Notice verse 5: "First take the log out of your own eye, **and then** you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye." In other words: deal with your own sin first, **then** help your brother with his.

The same chapter commands judgment of false prophets:
- Matthew 7:15-20—"Beware of false prophets... You will recognize them by their fruits."

And Jesus explicitly commands righteous judgment:
- John 7:24—"Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."

---

#### Objection 4: "We're all sinners; who are we to excommunicate?"

**Answer:**

Church discipline is not about **sinless perfection**—it's about **unrepentant rebellion**.

Every Christian sins (1 John 1:8, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves"). But not every Christian practices sin as a life pattern and refuses correction.

**The key is the person's response when confronted:**

- **Repentance:** "I was wrong. I'm sorry. Help me change." → Restoration, no discipline needed
- **Defiance:** "I don't think it's wrong. Mind your own business." → Church discipline

Matthew 18:15—"If he listens to you, you have gained your brother." The process stops if there's repentance. It escalates only if there's stubborn refusal.

**The difference between struggling believers and false professors:**

- Struggling believers: sin, feel conviction, confess, repent, fight against it
- False professors: sin, feel no conviction, justify it, refuse correction, continue in it

---

#### Objection 5: "What about grace and forgiveness?"

**Answer:**

Grace is not opposed to truth—grace comes **through** truth (John 1:14, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth"; v. 17, "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ").

Forgiveness requires repentance:
- Luke 17:3—"If your brother sins, rebuke him, and **if he repents**, forgive him"
- Acts 2:38—"Repent and be baptized... for the forgiveness of your sins"

You cannot forgive someone who is unrepentant. Forgiveness is a transaction: the offender repents, the offended forgives. If there's no repentance, there's no forgiveness—only a standing offer of forgiveness should they repent.

**Offering false assurance is not grace—it's cruelty.** It's like a doctor telling a cancer patient, "You're fine, don't worry about it," when the tumor is killing them. That's not compassion—it's malpractice.

Real grace confronts sin, calls for repentance, offers forgiveness when there's repentance, and disciplines when there's defiance.

---

### IX. Pastoral Application: How to Use This Material

#### 1. Preach the Warnings

Don't skip the hard passages. Don't soften them. Don't explain them away.

Modern evangelical preaching is almost entirely positive—"God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life, just believe." But half of Jesus' teaching is warning, judgment, hell, exclusion from the kingdom.

**Preach both sides:**
- The kindness and severity of God (Romans 11:22)
- The love of God and the wrath of God
- The grace of the gospel and the call to holiness

**Don't be afraid of offending people.** Better they be offended now by the truth than destroyed later by the lie.

---

#### 2. Call for Self-Examination

2 Corinthians 13:5—"Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves."

Regularly call your congregation to ask:
- Do I truly love Jesus, or just the benefits He offers?
- Is my life characterized by obedience or rebellion?
- Am I fighting sin or indulging it?
- Do I love the church and the people of God?
- Am I persevering, or am I drifting?

**Give them the biblical tests:**

- 1 John 2:3-6—Do I keep His commandments?
- 1 John 3:14—Do I love the brothers?
- 1 John 3:9—Do I practice sin or fight it?
- Hebrews 12:14—Am I pursuing holiness?
- Matthew 7:24-27—Am I doing what Jesus says, or just hearing?

---

#### 3. Practice Church Discipline

Follow Matthew 18 and 1 Corinthians 5. This is not optional.

**When to exercise discipline:**

- Unrepentant sexual immorality
- Unrepentant heresy (denying core doctrines)
- Divisiveness after multiple warnings
- Patterns of sin that persist despite correction

**How to do it:**

1. Private confrontation (Matthew 18:15)
2. Two or three witnesses (Matthew 18:16)
3. Tell it to the church (Matthew 18:17a)
4. Formal excommunication (Matthew 18:17b)

**What excommunication means:**

- The person is no longer treated as a Christian in good standing
- They are not allowed to take communion
- They are publicly announced as under church discipline
- Members are instructed not to socialize casually with them
- But they are still called to repentance, prayed for, and welcomed to attend services (where they will hear the gospel)

**If they repent:**

Restore them immediately (2 Corinthians 2:5-11). Forgive. Comfort. Reaffirm love.

---

#### 4. Don't Give False Assurance

Stop telling people they're saved based on:
- A prayer they prayed at age 7
- Walking an aisle at a youth camp
- Intellectual agreement with facts about Jesus
- A past emotional experience

**Biblical assurance is based on present evidence:**

- Am I walking in obedience? (1 John 2:3-6)
- Do I love other believers? (1 John 3:14)
- Do I confess my sin and fight it? (1 John 1:9, 3:9)
- Am I persevering in faith? (Hebrews 3:14, 1 John 2:19)

If someone is living in unrepentant sin, don't comfort them—warn them. Say: "Based on your life, I have no reason to believe you're saved. I urge you to repent and believe the gospel."

---

#### 5. Point to the Marks of Genuine Faith

Teach your congregation what saving faith actually is:

**Not:**
- Bare mental agreement (James 2:19)
- Emotional experience without life-change (Matthew 13:20-21, rocky soil)
- Religious activity without relationship (Matthew 7:22-23)

**But:**
- Entrusting yourself to Christ (John 1:12, 3:16)
- Living now as if God's promises are already fulfilled (Hebrews 11:1)
- Loving Christ (1 Corinthians 16:22)
- Obeying His commands (1 John 2:3-6, Matthew 7:21)
- Loving the brethren (1 John 3:14, John 13:35)
- Hating sin (1 John 3:9, Romans 7:15-24)
- Persevering to the end (Hebrews 3:14, Matthew 10:22, 24:13)

---

### X. Conclusion: The Kindness and Severity of God

Romans 11:22—"Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, **provided you continue in his kindness**. Otherwise you too will be cut off."

The modern church has emphasized **kindness** while ignoring **severity**. We've preached half the gospel—the half that makes people comfortable.

But Scripture holds both in tension. God is kind—He sent His Son to die for sinners. God is severe—He will judge all who reject His Son.

**The warnings are severe because the stakes are infinite.** False assurance sends people to hell while they sing worship songs. It fills churches with unregenerate members who think they're saved because they prayed a prayer or walked an aisle or grew up in the church.

**The crushing stone of Matthew 21:44 is coming.** The question is: Will you fall on Him now in repentance and be broken, or will He fall on you in judgment and crush you?

**Anathema is not cruelty—it's covenant clarity.** To pronounce anathema on false gospels is to protect people from poison. To practice church discipline is to guard the purity of the church and shock sinners into repentance.

The church must recover these categories. Not to be harsh. Not to be judgmental. But **to be faithful.**

2 Corinthians 5:11—"Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others."

We know what awaits those who reject Christ. We know the wrath to come. We know that many who think they're saved are not. And because we know these things, we warn. We confront. We discipline. We pronounce anathema on false gospels.

**Not out of hatred, but out of love. Not out of pride, but out of fear. Not out of harshness, but out of faithfulness to the One who will judge the living and the dead.**

"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" (Hebrews 10:31).

Let the church never forget it.

### XI. Appendix: Other Hard Sayings

This appendix addresses additional warning passages that are frequently misunderstood, ignored, or explained away.

---

#### A. John 15:1-6 — Branches Cut Off and Burned

> "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. **If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.**"

**The issue:**

Can a true believer be "in Christ" and then be cast into the fire?

**Reformed interpretation:**

The branches that are "in me" (ἐν ἐμοί) but "do not bear fruit" represent false professors. They are connected to Christ externally (in the visible church) but not vitally (not regenerate). They are like Judas—in the company of Jesus, but never truly united to Him.

Evidence:
- John 15:3—"Already you are clean because of the word"—the true disciples are already clean (regenerate)
- The fruitless branches are contrasted with those who "abide" (μένω)—to remain, continue, persevere
- 1 John 2:19—"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us"
- True branches bear fruit (v. 5); fruitless branches were never truly alive

**The warning:**

This passage warns against false profession. You can be externally connected to Christ (attend church, participate in the life of the community, even perform religious acts) without being vitally united to Him through regeneration.

The test: **Do you abide? Do you bear fruit?**

If there is no perseverance, no fruit, no continuing—you were never truly in Christ.

---

#### B. Matthew 24:10-13 — Many Will Fall Away

> "And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved."

**The issue:**

Jesus says "many will fall away" (πολλοὶ σκανδαλισθήσονται). Does this mean true believers can apostatize?

**Exegesis:**

- The context is the Olivet Discourse—Jesus' teaching on tribulation and His return
- "Many will fall away"—the verb σκανδαλίζω means to cause to stumble, to fall into sin, to apostatize
- "Their love will grow cold"—ψυγήσεται ἡ ἀγάπη—once warm affection for Christ becomes cold

**But verse 13:**

"But the one who endures to the end will be saved" (ὁ δὲ ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος οὗτος σωθήσεται).

**The principle:**

- Many will claim to be believers but will fall away under pressure
- The true believer is the one who **endures to the end**
- Perseverance is not optional—it's the mark of genuine faith

This does not mean true believers lose salvation—it means **those who fall away were never truly saved**. They were temporary believers, like the rocky soil in the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:20-21, "yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away").

---

#### C. Matthew 25:1-13 — The Ten Virgins

> "Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and **the door was shut**. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.' **But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.'** Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour."

**The parable:**

- Ten virgins wait for the bridegroom (Christ)
- All have lamps (external profession)
- Five have oil, five do not (the oil represents the Holy Spirit, regeneration, true saving faith)
- The bridegroom delays (Christ's return is delayed)
- All sleep (both true and false believers grow complacent)
- The bridegroom arrives—those with oil go in, those without are excluded

**Key details:**

1. **"The door was shut"**—finality; no second chance
2. **"Lord, lord, open to us"**—they call Him "Lord" (cf. Matthew 7:21-23)
3. **"I do not know you"**—the same verdict as Matthew 7:23

**The warning:**

External profession is not enough. Church attendance, religious activity, even waiting for Christ's return—none of this proves you're saved. The question is: **Do you have the oil? Are you truly regenerate?**

The five foolish virgins *thought* they were ready. They were shocked to be excluded. This is the tragedy of false assurance.

---

#### D. Matthew 25:31-46 — The Sheep and the Goats

> "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left... Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'... And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."

**The judgment:**

Christ separates sheep from goats based on how they treated "the least of these my brothers" (v. 40).

**Common misunderstanding:**

This is not teaching salvation by works. The works are **evidence**, not **cause**, of salvation.

- The sheep served Christ's brothers because they loved Christ
- The goats did not serve because they had no love for Christ or His people
- Both groups are surprised—the sheep didn't think they were doing anything special; the goats thought their religious profession was enough

**The terrifying reality:**

The goats address Jesus as "Lord" (v. 44). They expected to be accepted. But Jesus says, "Depart from me, you cursed" (v. 41).

**The warning:**

You can have a profession of faith, religious activity, even miracles (Matthew 7:22)—and still be a goat. The test is: **Do you love Christ's people? Do you serve them sacrificially?**

1 John 3:14—"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death."

#### E. Luke 13:23-30 — Strive to Enter Through the Narrow Door

> "And someone said to him, 'Lord, will those who are saved be few?' And he said to them, 'Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, "Lord, open to us," then he will answer you, "I do not know where you come from." Then you will begin to say, "We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets." But he will say, "I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!" In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out.'"

**Key phrases:**

1. **"Strive to enter"** (ἀγωνίζεσθε εἰσελθεῖν)—the verb ἀγωνίζομαι means to struggle, fight, compete with effort
   - This is not works-righteousness—it's the fight of faith
   - Salvation is by grace through faith, but faith fights (1 Timothy 6:12, "Fight the good fight of the faith")

2. **"Many will seek to enter and will not be able"**—seeking is not enough; many will try and fail

3. **"The door will be shut"**—there is a point of no return; the opportunity will end

4. **"We ate and drank in your presence"**—these people had external association with Jesus
   - They were in His presence (like the crowds that followed Him)
   - But they did not truly know Him

5. **"I do not know where you come from"**—Jesus disowns them

6. **"Workers of evil"** (ἐργάται ἀδικίας)—despite their religious profession, their lives were characterized by unrighteousness

**The warning:**

Proximity to Jesus is not salvation. You can sit under gospel preaching, participate in church life, eat the Lord's Supper—and still be lost. The question is: **Have you entered through the narrow door? Are you striving in the fight of faith?**

#### F. Revelation 3:5 — Blotted from the Book of Life?

> "The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and **I will never blot his name out of the book of life**. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels."

**The issue:**

Does this imply that some names *are* blotted out of the book of life? Can a believer lose salvation?

**Exegesis:**

The promise is given to "the one who conquers" (ὁ νικῶν). This is Revelation's language for genuine believers:
- Revelation 2:7—"To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life"
- Revelation 2:11—"The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death"
- Revelation 21:7—"The one who conquers will have this heritage"

**The promise:** "I will never blot his name out of the book of life" (οὐ μὴ ἐξαλείψω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ)—the double negative (οὐ μὴ) is emphatic: "I will by no means ever blot out."

**Two interpretations:**

1. **The promise implies the threat** (Arminian view)
   - If Jesus promises not to blot out the conqueror's name, this implies others' names *will* be blotted out
   - Those who don't conquer lose their salvation

2. **The promise assures perseverance** (Reformed view)
   - Jesus promises that true believers (conquerors) will never be blotted out
   - This is assurance of eternal security for those who persevere
   - Those whose names are blotted out were never truly written in (they were in the visible church but not the invisible church)

**Supporting evidence for the Reformed view:**

- Revelation 13:8—"The book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world"—names were written before creation
- Revelation 17:8—"Those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world"
- Philippians 4:3—"Whose names are in the book of life"—Paul speakswith certainty about those whose names are written
- Revelation 20:15—"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire"—the issue at final judgment is whether your name *was* written, not whether it *was but got blotted out*

**The correct interpretation:**

Jesus promises that those who conquer (genuine believers who persevere) will never have their names blotted out. This is not a threat to true believers—it's an assurance. The conqueror is secure.

But it is a warning to false professors: if you do not conquer (if you do not persevere in faith), your profession was false. Your name was never truly written in the Lamb's book of life.

**Application:**

The question is not "Can I lose my salvation?" but "Am I a conqueror? Am I persevering in faith? Is my name written in the book of life?"

True believers persevere because God keeps them (1 Peter 1:5, "kept by the power of God through faith"). Those who fall away were never truly saved (1 John 2:19).

#### G. Hebrews 3:12-14 — Take Care Lest There Be in Any of You an Evil, Unbelieving Heart

> "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called 'today,' that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have come to share in Christ, **if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end**."

**The warning:**

- Addressed to "brothers"—professing believers
- Danger: "an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away" (καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας ἐν τῷ ἀποστῆναι)
  - "Unbelieving" (ἀπιστία)—lack of faith
  - "Fall away" (ἀποστῆναι)—apostatize, depart from
- Command: "Exhort one another every day"—corporate responsibility to prevent apostasy
- Warning: "that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin" (σκληρυνθῇ... ἀπάτῃ τῆς ἁμαρτίας)—sin deceives and hardens

**The key verse: Hebrews 3:14**

"For we have come to share in Christ, **if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end**" (μέτοχοι γὰρ τοῦ Χριστοῦ γεγόναμεν, ἐάνπερ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς ὑποστάσεως μέχρι τέλους βεβαίαν κατάσχωμεν).

**The grammar:**

- "We have come to share" (γεγόναμεν)—perfect tense, completed action with ongoing results
- "If indeed we hold" (ἐάνπερ... κατάσχωμεν)—conditional particle + subjunctive = condition of uncertainty from human perspective
- "Firm to the end" (μέχρι τέλους βεβαίαν)—steadfast, secure, until the end

**Two interpretations:**

1. **Arminian:** True believers can lose salvation if they don't persevere

2. **Reformed:** Perseverance proves you were truly a sharer in Christ; apostasy proves you never were

**The Reformed view is correct because:**

- The condition is **evidential**, not **causative**—holding firm doesn't *make* you a sharer in Christ; it *proves* you are
- The author is warning the visible church that contains both wheat and tares
- He's saying: "Some of you who profess Christ may fall away—and that will prove you never truly shared in Him"
- This is identical to 1 John 2:19—"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us"

**The pastoral point:**

The warning is real. Apostasy happens. People fall away. But when they do, it reveals they were never truly regenerate. True believers persevere because God keeps them.

**Application:**

Don't presume on your profession. Examine yourself. Are you holding firm your original confidence? Are you continuing in faith? Or are you drifting?

Hebrews 2:1—"Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it."

---

#### H. Hebrews 4:1 — Fear Lest Any of You Should Seem to Have Failed to Reach It

> "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it."

**The context:**

The author has just finished discussing Israel's failure to enter God's rest (Canaan) because of unbelief (Hebrews 3:16-19). Now he applies it to the new covenant people.

**"Let us fear"** (φοβηθῶμεν)—not servile terror, but godly fear, reverent awe mixed with caution

**"Lest any of you should seem to have failed"** (μή ποτε... δοκῇ... ὑστερηκέναι)
- "Seem" (δοκῇ)—appear to have, give evidence of having
- "Failed to reach" (ὑστερηκέναι)—fallen short, come short of

**The warning:**

Some in the visible church may *seem* to be on the path to God's rest but will ultimately fail to reach it—just as Israel left Egypt but died in the wilderness without entering Canaan.

**The issue is unbelief:**

Hebrews 4:2—"For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened."

They heard the gospel, but they did not believe. External participation in the covenant community does not save—only faith saves.

**Application:**

Don't assume that because you're in the visible church, you're saved. Don't assume that because you heard the gospel, you believed the gospel. Examine yourself. Do you have faith? Are you resting in Christ alone?

#### I. James 5:19-20 — Save His Soul from Death

> "My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."

**The issue:**

Can a true believer "wander from the truth" and have his "soul saved from death"? Does this imply believers can lose salvation?

**Exegesis:**

- "If anyone among you" (ἐάν τις ἐν ὑμῖν)—someone in the visible church
- "Wanders from the truth" (πλανηθῇ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας)—strays, goes astray
- "Brings him back" (ἐπιστρέψῃ)—turns him back, restores him
- "Will save his soul from death" (σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου)—rescue from eternal death

**Two possibilities:**

1. **True believer who strays and is restored**
   - The person is genuinely saved but falls into serious sin
   - Another believer confronts and restores him
   - This prevents the sin from leading to premature physical death (cf. 1 Corinthians 11:30, some died because of their sin) or prevents the person from apostatizing fully

2. **False professor who is brought to true faith**
   - The person was in the visible church but not truly saved
   - He "wanders from the truth"—apostatizes
   - Someone evangelizes him and he truly believes for the first time
   - His soul is saved from eternal death

**The second interpretation is more likely** because:
- James describes the person as "a sinner" (ἁμαρτωλόν)—not "a brother" or "one of you"
- "Save his soul from death" is language of conversion, not restoration of a believer
- James 1:21—"The implanted word, which is able to save your souls"—salvation language
- The context is about rescuing someone from apostasy, not just correcting a struggling believer

**Application:**

When someone in the church wanders from the truth—whether through sin or false doctrine—pursue them. Confront them. Call them back. You may be the instrument God uses to save their soul from death.

This is the redemptive purpose of church discipline.

#### J. 2 Timothy 2:11-13 — If We Deny Him, He Will Deny Us

> "The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; **if we deny him, he also will deny us**; if we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself."

**The structure:**

Four conditional statements:
1. "If we have died with him, we will also live with him"—union with Christ in His death and resurrection
2. "If we endure, we will also reign with him"—perseverance leads to glorification
3. **"If we deny him, he also will deny us"**—apostasy leads to rejection
4. "If we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself"—God's faithfulness is not dependent on ours

**The key: verse 12b**

"If we deny him, he also will deny us" (εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα, κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς).

This echoes Jesus in Matthew 10:33—"But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven."

**The warning:**

To deny Christ is to be denied by Christ. This is not about a moment of weakness (like Peter's denials, which were followed by repentance). This is about persistent, final denial—apostasy.

**But verse 13:**

"If we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself."

**The difference between verse 12b and verse 13:**

- Verse 12b: **Deny** (ἀρνέομαι)—repudiate, disown, apostatize
- Verse 13: **Faithless** (ἀπιστοῦμεν)—lack faith, fail to believe, struggle with unbelief

Verse 12b describes apostasy—a deliberate, final rejection of Christ. Verse 13 describes the struggles of genuine believers who sometimes falter but do not utterly abandon Christ.

God remains faithful to His elect even when they struggle with doubt or temporary unbelief. But if someone ultimately denies Christ, Christ will deny them.

**Application:**

Perseverance is not optional. Those who endure will reign. Those who deny Christ will be denied. But take comfort: God's faithfulness upholds weak believers. If you are struggling but not denying—if you are fighting unbelief rather than embracing apostasy—God will not let you go.

---

#### K. 1 Timothy 4:1 — Some Will Depart from the Faith

> "Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons."

**The prophecy:**

"Some will depart from the faith" (ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως)—the verb ἀφίστημι means to stand away from, withdraw from, apostatize.

**The cause:**

- "Devoting themselves to deceitful spirits" (προσέχοντες πνεύμασιν πλάνοις)—paying attention to, giving heed to deceiving spirits
- "Teachings of demons" (διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων)—doctrines originating from demons

**The nature of false teaching:**

Verses 2-3 give examples: "through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving."

False teaching is demonic in origin, ascetic in practice (forbidding what God permits), and leads people away from the true faith.

**The question:**

Can true believers apostatize?

**The answer:**

No—those who apostatize were never truly believers. But the text warns that "some" in the visible church will depart. This means:
- Not everyone who professes faith has real faith
- False teaching is a real danger and leads some to apostasy
- The church must guard against false doctrine

**Application:**

Be on guard against false teaching. Test everything by Scripture (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Acts 17:11). Don't assume that everyone in leadership is sound—Paul warned the Ephesian elders that wolves would arise from among them (Acts 20:29-30).

---

#### L. 1 Timothy 1:18-20 — Shipwreck of Faith

> "This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme."

**The metaphor:**

"Made shipwreck of their faith" (περὶ τὴν πίστιν ἐναυάγησαν)—their faith was destroyed, like a ship wrecked on the rocks.

**The cause:**

"By rejecting" faith and a good conscience—they pushed away (ἀπωσάμενοι) what they once professed.

**The examples:**

Hymenaeus and Alexander—Paul names them publicly as false teachers who have shipwrecked their faith.

**Paul's action:**

"I have handed over to Satan"—formal excommunication (cf. 1 Corinthians 5:5).

**The purpose:**

"That they may learn not to blaspheme"—still redemptive in intent, though the outlook is grim.

**The interpretation:**

Did these men lose genuine salvation, or were they always false professors?

The text does not explicitly say. But given:
- 1 John 2:19—"They went out from us, but they were not of us"
- The fact that apostasy reveals, not transforms
- Paul's certainty in pronouncing judgment on them

It is most consistent to say: their shipwreck revealed they never had true faith. They professed, but their profession was false.

**Application:**

Reject false teaching. Guard a good conscience. Don't play games with sin—it leads to shipwreck. And don't be surprised when some who seemed to be believers apostatize—it reveals what was always true.

---

#### M. Philippians 2:12 — Work Out Your Salvation with Fear and Trembling

> "Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."

**Common misunderstanding:**

"Work out your salvation" means you earn your salvation through works.

**Correct understanding:**

- "Work out" (κατεργάζεσθε)—work to completion, bring to fruition, accomplish
- This is not "work *for* your salvation" but "work *out* your salvation"—live out what God has worked in

**Verse 13 clarifies:**

"For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

- God works *in* (ἐνεργῶν ἐν ὑμῖν)—He produces the desire and the action
- We work *out* (κατεργάζεσθε)—we live out what He produces

**"With fear and trembling":**

This is not terror but reverent awe—recognizing the seriousness of salvation and the danger of presumption.

**Application:**

Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. But saving faith produces obedience. Work out (live out, demonstrate, bring to completion) the salvation God has worked in you. And do it with sober awareness of the stakes—don't presume, don't be careless, don't coast.

---

#### N. Colossians 1:21-23 — If Indeed You Continue in the Faith

> "And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, **if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel** that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister."

**The promise:**

Christ has reconciled you... in order to present you holy and blameless before God.

**The condition:**

"If indeed you continue in the faith" (εἴ γε ἐπιμένετε τῇ πίστει).

- "If indeed" (εἴ γε)—assumes the condition is true, but acknowledges it needs to be proven
- "Continue" (ἐπιμένετε)—remain, persevere, stay
- "Stable and steadfast" (τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι)—founded, established, firm
- "Not shifting from the hope of the gospel" (μὴ μετακινούμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου)—not moving away, not apostatizing

**Is this a threat or an assurance?**

**It's both:**

- **Threat:** If you do not continue, you will not be presented holy and blameless—because your profession was false
- **Assurance:** True believers *will* continue because God keeps them (Philippians 1:6, "He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion")

**The condition is evidential:**

Continuing in faith doesn't *earn* your presentation before God—it *proves* you were truly reconciled. Apostasy doesn't make you lose salvation—it reveals you never had it.

**Application:**

Are you continuing in the faith? Are you stable and steadfast? Or are you shifting away from the gospel? Your perseverance is the evidence of your reconciliation.

### XII. Final Summary: What the Hard Sayings Teach

Synthesizing all the warning passages and hard sayings, the consistent message of Scripture is:

1. **False assurance is rampant and deadly**
   - Many think they're saved who are not (Matthew 7:21-23, 25:11-12)
   - External religious experience does not prove regeneration (Matthew 7:22, Hebrews 6:4-6)
   - Profession must be backed by possession (James 2:14-26, 1 John 2:3-6)

2. **Perseverance is the evidence of genuine faith**
   - True believers endure to the end (Matthew 24:13, Hebrews 3:14, Colossians 1:23)
   - Those who fall away prove they were never truly saved (1 John 2:19, Hebrews 6:4-6)
   - God keeps His elect; they cannot be snatched from His hand (John 10:27-29, Romans 8:38-39)

3. **Apostasy is final and reveals what was always true**
   - Some apostasy is irreversible (Hebrews 6:6, 12:17)
   - Apostasy does not transform—it reveals (1 John 2:19)
   - The apostate was never regenerate, though they had external covenant privileges

4. **The warnings are real and must be heeded**
   - Don't presume on grace (Romans 11:22, Hebrews 4:1)
   - Examine yourself (2 Corinthians 13:5)
   - Work out your salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12)
   - Strive to enter through the narrow door (Luke 13:24)

5. **God's faithfulness upholds His elect**
   - He who began a good work will complete it (Philippians 1:6)
   - Christ loses none the Father gives Him (John 6:39)
   - We are kept by the power of God through faith (1 Peter 1:5)
   - If we are faithless, He remains faithful (2 Timothy 2:13)

6. **The church must guard the gospel and practice discipline**
   - Anathema on false gospels (Galatians 1:8-9)
   - Church discipline for unrepentant sin (Matthew 18:15-20, 1 Corinthians 5)
   - Avoid and mark false teachers (Romans 16:17, 2 John 10-11, Titus 3:10)
   - Pursue and restore the wandering (James 5:19-20, Galatians 6:1)

7. **The crushing stone is coming**
   - Fall on Christ now in repentance, or He will fall on you in judgment (Matthew 21:44)
   - There is no third option
   - The door will be shut (Matthew 25:10, Luke 13:25)
   - It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Hebrews 10:31)

---

### XIII. Conclusion of the Appendix

The hard sayings of Scripture are not contradictions—they are warnings. They confront our false assurance, expose our presumption, and call us to self-examination.

The modern church has ignored these passages because they're uncomfortable. They don't fit neatly into "once saved, always comfortable" theology. They challenge easy-believism and question cheap grace.

But these warnings are in Scripture for a reason: **because false assurance damns**.

The solution is not to live in constant doubt—it's to examine yourself by the marks of genuine faith:
- Do you love Christ? (1 Corinthians 16:22)
- Do you obey His commands? (1 John 2:3-6, Matthew 7:21)
- Do you love other believers? (1 John 3:14)
- Do you confess and fight your sin? (1 John 1:9, 3:9)
- Are you persevering in faith? (Hebrews 3:14, Colossians 1:23)

If you can answer "yes" to these questions—not perfectly, but genuinely—then you have biblical grounds for assurance.

But if you cannot—if your life is characterized by love of sin, hatred of God's people, refusal to obey, and no perseverance—then all the "I prayed the prayer" assurance in the world will not save you.

**Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves** (2 Corinthians 13:5).

"Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 1:10-11).

The warnings are real. The stakes are infinite. The gospel is true. And Christ is coming.

**Marana tha—Our Lord, come!**
